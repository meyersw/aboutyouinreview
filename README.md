Your assignment is to create a website introducing yourself to your classmates. 

Your site should include a minimum of 3 pages, 
•	home page - tell us about you, 
•	"for fun"  page - maybe interests, hobbies, recent event you would like to share etc 
•	goals - what classes have you taken, which degree program are you in, WHY are you pursuing this degree (what motivates you) or WHY are you taking THIS class (besides its required for my degree)

Your project MUST look professional, have a complete navigation to each page and should look cohesive across all the pages. 

HTML must include:
