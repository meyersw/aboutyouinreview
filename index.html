        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Greetings,</p>
        <p>I am William Meyers and I'm happy to visit with you and tell you a little about myself.</p>
        <p>For the past 9 years I have served as the Mathematics instructor for <a
                href="https://academics.otc.edu/middlecollege/">OTC Middle College</a>. This has been the most
            professionaly and personally fulfulling job I could have hoped for. I often say of my job that I don't
            <em>have</em> to get up to go to work each day, instead I <em>get</em> to go to work each day.
        </p>
        <p>In addtion to my day job, I have the privlege of working with the <a
                href="https://academics.otc.edu/tlc/">Speckman Tutoring and Learning Center</a> here on the OTC campus
            as well. This is a fantastic resouce for students to use when they need need help in just about any subject
            of study, or just a quite place to hang out.</p>
        <p>In addtion to my professional life, I'm also a father of two great kids, and a grandfather for a very
            energetic and sassy three year old. Completing my family would be my beautiful wife, Jennifer and our two
            cats, Jack and Bruiser.</p>
